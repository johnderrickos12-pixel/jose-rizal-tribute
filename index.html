                <p>Jose Rizal was born on June 19, 1861, in Calamba, Laguna, to Francisco Mercado II and Teodora Alonzo Realonda. His family, though prosperous, faced the social injustices of Spanish colonial rule. His early education at a local Spanish school and later at the Ateneo de Manila University sparked his interest in social justice.</p>

            <div class="card">
                <p>In 1882, Rizal journeyed to Europe for further education, studying at the University of Madrid. He became involved with the Propaganda Movement and established connections with various reformists. It was during this period that he conceptualized and later founded La Liga Filipina, an organization aimed at uniting Filipinos and advocating for reforms.</p>
                <p>During his travels, he also met Josephine Bracken, who would later become his wife.</p>

            <div class="card">
                <p>Rizal's most impactful works, <strong>Noli Me Tángere</strong> (Touch Me Not) and <strong>El filibusterismo</strong> (The Reign of Greed), were published during his time in Europe. These novels fiercely critiqued the Spanish colonial government and the Catholic friars, exposing their abuses and igniting the flames of Filipino nationalism.</p>

            <div class="card">
                <p>Despite his calls for peaceful reform, Rizal was arrested upon his return to the Philippines in 1896, accused of sedition and rebellion. He was sentenced to death and executed by firing squad on December 30, 1896, in Bagumbayan (now Rizal Park), Manila.</p>

                <p>His martyrdom, however, fueled the Philippine Revolution, making him an enduring symbol of resistance and a national hero. His writings and sacrifices continue to inspire generations of Filipinos in their pursuit of freedom and self-determination.</p>
